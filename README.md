# 🚀 YOLOv5 Model Comparison (YOLOv5n vs YOLOv5s)

This project compares the performance of two YOLOv5 object detection models — `YOLOv5n` (nano) and `YOLOv5s` (small) — using the same set of 10 real-world images. It evaluates each model based on:

- 🔁 **Average Inference Time**
- 🎯 **Total Detections**
- 📦 **Class Diversity**

All results are logged to CSV files, and output images are saved with bounding boxes.
